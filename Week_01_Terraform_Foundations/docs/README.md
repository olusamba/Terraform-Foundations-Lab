# Terraform Foundations Lab (Week 1)

## 🎯 Objective
Understand and implement Terraform basics to manage AWS resources in a reproducible and controlled way.

## 🧱 Environment
- AWS Free Tier
- Terraform v1.9.0
- VS Code + AWS CLI configured

## 🚀 Key Steps
1. Initialize the Terraform project with `terraform init`
2. Create the first S3 bucket using Terraform
3. Add variables and outputs for better flexibility
4. Modularize the code into reusable components
5. Document and publish to GitHub

## ⚙️ Main Commands

terraform plan  
terraform apply  
terraform destroy  

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- The Terraform state file (`.tfstate`) must always be safely stored and versioned.  
- Modular code improves scalability and readability.  
- Every resource should be documented and version-controlled.  

## 📸 Results
Add screenshots, key logs, or snippets of Terraform code that illustrate your progress.
